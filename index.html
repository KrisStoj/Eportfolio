				<h1>Teamwork</h1>
				<p>
					Within my time working at S+P, I have almost worked for most of the time within a team setting,
					communicating not only with external clients, but internally as well with colleagues in order to produce an effective design.
					Some major projects that I have been fortunate enough to take part in include Ed Square residential designs,
					a multi-stage development containing over 300 townhomes, in which we have successfully worked on their 1-4 stages,
					allowing us to design their hydraulic systems.
					I was also assigned to assist in the design of a 40 storey building located in the centre of Sydney CBD,
					adjacent (and slightly hovering over) to central station, which I believe is a result of my hard work and developing skills.

				<h1>Leadership</h1>
				<p>
					As a previous employee had decided to part ways with the company, 
					I was given the opportunity to guide the drafting team as their team leader. 
					I took this role as a temporary to give management more time to decide on their next steps. 
					Management had offered me the role to supervise the drafters because of my own managerial skills. 
					Since the beginning of 2022, I have been actively planning, supervising and teaching the team on a day to day basis, 
					acting as their main point of contact for any issues, problems and/or help.

				<p>
					As I am currently in my 5th year at university,
					I am currently in the process of researching and planning my capstone project in order to complete my degree.
					Although currently I am in the early stages of researching relevant articles and compiling a report together,
					the research is focused on the XXXXXXXXX

				<h1>About Me</h1>
				<div class="aboutme-body">
					<img src="sources/Kristian Stojcevski.jpg">
					<p>
						50% Student, 50% Professional, 100% Engineer. A phrase created to illustrate not only the professional side of engineers,
						but also their adaptability in new understanding new concepts & skills.
						I strongly believe this phrase perfectly summarises professional engineers in all disciplines.
						This also links to my current position in a literal sense, of being a full-time student, and full-time engineer.
						As an individual, I love to be challenge with tasks that require critical thinking,
						that leads to a satisfying outcome and overall can be reflected on for future endeavours.
						Currently, I believe I have learnt a lot as an engineer, but only being 2 years within my current career,
						I know there is still a long way to go before I become a professional engineer.

				<h1>Professional Experience</h1>
				<p>
					Sparks + Partners Consulting Engineers
					Beginning the journey as a junior draftsperson, I learnt the basics of CAD, specifically 2D modelling.
					As I progressed time-wise, I began to understand what exactly I was doing, being hydraulic designing.
					With more experience on 2D modelling and beginning to learn how to 3D model, I was able to do basic design work,
					utilising engineering principles and following Australian standards.
					A milestone in my early career, being promoted to a junior hydraulic engineer. With this change came more responsibilities.
					I had already advanced my knowledge as a 2D & 3D modeller,
					becoming one of the individuals other employees would come to in seek of assistance.
					I began to design work in conjunction with modelling, and would later get it reviewed by a team leader for quality assurance.
